He started schooling at Lively Kiddies Nursery and Primary School, Agege Lagos, Nigeria. After completing elementary school, he proceeded to Boys Secondary School, Agege, Lagos, Nigeria where is obtained his West African Examination Certificate. Zinoleesky developed a passion for music at a tender age. In his words, he stated that his love for music became stronger after being followed by Kizz Daniel on Instagram. This was a result of the rap video he dropped on Instagram. Zinoleesky turned down Davidoâ€™s offer to sign him into DMW. Naira Marley later signed him into Marlian music in December 2019. He was signed alongside Mohbad, CBlack, and Fabian Blu. The four artists were brought on stage at the Marlian Fest. in Eko Hotel and Suites on December 31st, 2019.",
